Some days later, I joined her Dataviz Guild which she led organisation-wide. In a span of a year, I had learnt so much from her not only about Dataviz but about design and its related topics, about career and even about something as off-topic as Sign Language. KL’s knowledge is both broad and deep ranging. This makes her well-suited to effortlessly slip into any role required of her. I was really impressed with the Design System Documentation Framework, which was very well thought out in terms of structure and content. Her easygoing and adaptable demeanour also makes her easy and fun to work with.",
